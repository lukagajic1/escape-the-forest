|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **List and/or dictionary comprehensions used correctly** | `make_board` in game.py (lines 54–57) uses dictionary comprehension                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Selection using if-statements**                        | `validate_move` in game.py uses selection to determine how character moves based on input lines 227-236                                                                                                                                   |
| **Repetition using for-loop and/or while loop**          | `game` function in game.py (line 101) and `display_map`function (line 581) use loops                                                                                                                                                      |

| **Board creation using dictionary + tuples**             | `make_board` in game.py uses tuple keys for coordinates (lines 54-57)                                                                                                                                                                     |

| **Gameplay ends properly**                               | `check_if_goal_attained` checks when character is at end coordinates (9, 9) and `game` lines 115-120 makes sure level 3 is needed to begin final challenge, `game` also handles win (boss defeat) and lose (HP reaches 0) (lines 146-150) |
| **Movement + boundaries correct**                        | `validate_move` in game.py prevents out-of-bounds movement (line 238)                                                                                                                                                                     |

| **Final boss implemented**                               | `final_boss_encounter`(lines 513-567) handles end-game challenge                                                                                                                                                                          |
